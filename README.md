# 30days Challenge
Code and learn for the next 30 days.

I wanted to code something solid regardless of its project size or difficulty outside of work. Preferably something small bite-size so I would be able to continue this challenge without putting too much stress on myself.

The aim is to build a habit of giving myself an hour or so daily to learn something new or something I have been using but not knowing how it works in details.

And then main thing is to have that 'ah-hah' moment everyday. What a bliss that would be !
