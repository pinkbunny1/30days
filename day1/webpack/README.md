# Day 1 : Webpack

- https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/
- https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json
- Read and followed the instructions from the documentations (Getting Started)
- The documentation is very well documented and I would like to continue exploring the features that the Webpack offers. But for now, I gotta go and Kayak at Töölö !

- Big take away : package.json is a map of the project, lists what libraries the project needs to run. webpack.config is a map for webpack so it knows which file to transform from and where to put the output file.
