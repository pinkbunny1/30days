# day3 : Preloading from scratch

- Using CSS alone to create a preloader. It is incredibly simple with a use of Border and Animation features from CSS.

- I am starting to enjoy what CSS has to offer. I had no idea how great CSS was before !

- Tomorrow I will add this feature to my Star Wars page and also add sliding up effect when the page is ready.

- Today was Monday and it was tough to continue with a project especially on Monday. I now have a huge respect for people who can continuously keep their project daily. It is not hard but hard to keep focus.

- As a way to prevent myself from getting distracted, I should put a hard deadline for example, finish this in one hour, so I know there is a ending time to which I should produce a certain output. I definitely work better when there is a deadline.
